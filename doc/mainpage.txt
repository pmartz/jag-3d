\section jagDraw

This module contains host-side data store and multi-context support
for many OpenGL commands.

This is the only module that executes OpenGL commands. All jagDraw
OpenGL code is compatible with an OpenGL v4.0 core profile / forward
compatible (GL4cpfc) context.

Note that hardware mipmap generation is unavailable in GL4cpfc. Jag will need
host-side image filtering code to replace this functionality.

Direct OpenGL support:

\li \link jagDraw::VertexArrayObject Vertex Array Objects \endlink
\li \link jagDraw::DrawCommand Drawing commands \endlink
\li \link jagDraw::BufferObject Buffer Objects \endlink
\li \link jagDraw::Shader Shader Objects \endlink
\li \link jagDraw::Program Program Objects \endlink
\li \link jagDraw::Uniform Uniform Variables \endlink

Higher level constructs:
\li \link jagDraw::Drawable Drawable Objects \endlink

\section jagSG

jagSG, the scene graph module, does not currently exist.

\section ProjectRoadmap Upcoming Work and Project Notes

\li The Uniform class needs to be fleshed out.
\li Need to develop the plugin infrastructure and create an OSG-based image
loader as soon as possible. It's difficult to do anything interesting in GL4cpfc
without textures.
\li "State sorting" (sorting Drawables based on the commands that configure GL for
rendering) needs to be implemented.
