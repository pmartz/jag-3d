\page JagSpecification JAG Specification

\section SpexIntroduction Introduction

JAG specifies the behavior of an OpenGL-based rendering toolkit. JAG does not specify
function or class names or a language binding. There could be multiple JAG-compliant
toolkit implementations, of which Jag3D is one. It is not a requirement that code written
for one JAG-compliant toolkit will port directly, or even easily, to another JAG-compliant
toolkit.


\section SpecComponenets Specification Components

The specification is composed of two parts: this \a Introduction document,
and the <a href="annotated.html">Doxygen-generated class reference</a>
from the Jag3D source code.

The reference material for each class and member function contains the following
specifications:
\li Thread-safety requirements.
\li OpenGL footprint requirements (if applicable).
\li Dependency requirements.
\li Variable default values, if applicable.
\li Intended usage.
\li Known specification violations.


\subsection SpecThread Thread-safety Requirements
\li Thread Safe: The code employes explicit locking.
\li Context Safe: The code is thread safe when executed by a
context-specific thread. Multiple context threads must have
thread-specific instances of any C++ objects marked as "Context Safe". 
\li Read-Only: The code is thread safe because it does not modify
any shared memory.
\li Unsafe: The code is not thread safe.


\subsection SpecOpenGL OpenGL Footprint Requirements

for functions that issue OpenGL commands, this spec documents
what commands are issued and under which circumstances.


\subsection SpecDependency Dependency Requirements
