This is a port of the ABuffer OpenGL example found at:
    http://blog.icare3d.org/2010/07/opengl-40-abuffer-v20-linked-lists-of.html

The purpose of this example is to show how OpenGL algorithms can be
incorporated into JAG rendering. A second example, "abuffer", shows
how JAG rendering can be incorportated into an existing OpenGL
application.
